# Bounded negative results

A failed set of C variants is evidence about those variants under those inputs.
It is not proof that C cannot reproduce the reference, that the residue is a floor,
or that the original used assembly. [Assembly evidence](assembly-audit.md) has a
separate acceptance rule.

## Before reopening a probe

Check the archived experiments, current source, native body and original TU context.
A new attempt needs a specific new fact: corrected call/field/stack evidence,
a different original compilation context, a missing definition, or a controlled
compiler result. Renaming locals or repeating exhausted permutations is not one.

## Record a useful negative result

State the target/VA, exact inputs, variants tried, observed effect, limits and replay
receipt. Keep one record per experiment family. Do not repeat whole-project status
or label a byte delta as its own cause.

Use [C shapes](msvc6-c-shapes.md) for expression hypotheses and
[register allocation](msvc6-allocator.md) for value/slot analysis. Preserve canonical
whole-TU game flags; diagnostic overrides do not become production policy.

Older write-ups are in the [archive](goal-history.md#full-notebooks) under this filename.
